|============> Why this fork? <============|
|:---:|  
|I forked this awesome project to port back additional code to make it compatible with a LXD backend, using lightweight system containers instead of VMs.|
|I'm aiming for minimal impact on original code so for now check the docs in the lxd folder|
|PLEASE DO NOT BUILD A VAULT CLUSTER USING THIS FORK TO STORE ACTUAL SECRETS - IT IS NOT SAFE AT ALL --> MEMLOCK IS DISABLED - If you are building a real cluster to store real secrets, use the original code and real instances|   


Installs & confgures Hashicorp's Consul & Vault + HAProxy to run as an HA cluster

Although the vault installation creates OpenSSL TLS private key, CSR & resultant certificate, the URI modules in these roles currently use "validate_certs: no". It is up to you to complete the TLS configuration.

> __WARNING__ - When vault is initialized, the master key shards & root token are stored in the ansible user's HOME dir on the Ansible control machine. This is __NOT__ good practice, but was used to get things running. I am considering various future options that won't break the non-interactive execution of the playbooks, such as ansible vault'ing the file with a pre-defined ansible vault password file. But this is really no more secure than the current setup. Hashicorp vault has the ability to encrypt the master key shards using [PGP, GPG, and Keybase](<https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/pgp-gpg-keybase.html>). This is the ideal solution but might prove too difficult to implement while maintaining non-interactive playbook execution.

Heavily based on the documentation supplied by HashiCorp at <https://www.vaultproject.io/guides/operations/vault-ha-consul.html>

Currently tested on these Operating Systems
* Oracle Linux/RHEL/CentOS 7 (Note: Enables EPEL repo using Jeff Geerling's [EPEL role](<https://galaxy.ansible.com/geerlingguy/repo-epel/>))
* Debian/Stretch64

Requirements
------------

* Hashicorp Vagrant
* Ansible 2.5 or higher

Dependencies
------------

* Requires elevated root privileges
* Copy Ansible control machine user's public SSH key (usually called id_rsa.pub) into the vagrant working directory

Getting the code
----------------

`git clone https://github.com/AdamGoldsmith/consul-vault.git --recurse-submodules`

Running the deployment
----------------------

```
cd vagrant
vagrant up
```

On the Ansible Control Machine  

__To deploy__

`./deploy.sh`

or

`ansible-playbook playbooks/site.yml --tags 'epel,install,init,unseal,configure,approle,sshkeysign'`

__To remove__

`./deploy.sh -t remove`

or

`ansible-playbook playbooks/site.yml --tags 'remove'`

Known Issues
------------

If you get the message "You need to have PyOpenSSL>=0.15 to generate CSRs", then it is most likely an issue with the OpenSSL package that python has imported. When pyOpenSSL is installed/upgraded via the PIP Ansible module in this playbok, it will install the python package under /usr/lib/pythonx.x/site-packages, however it is possible that another OpenSSL python package could be installed under /usr/lib64/pythonx.x/site-packages that is being loaded in preference to the higher-level package.  
In order to prevent this happening, temporarily move the directory "/usr/lib64/pythonx.x/site-packages/OpenSSL" out of the way while running this playbook.
